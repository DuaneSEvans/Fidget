                    Jason Yu from Fidget has partnered with Kathryn Atkinson from Island Clinical Counselling to deliver a BFRB Workshop. In 4 weekly 60-minute Zoom sessions, participants will explore the experience and management of Body Focused Repetitive Behaviours.  It is intended for adults ages 17 and up or parents of children who experience BFRBs.  There will be an opportunity to ask questions about their diagnosis, symptoms, and treatment for this condition.
                </p>

                    You will be invited to purchase a package of four sessions after booking your first week workshop.  After purchase you will be sent a Zoom link for access to the workshop. If you miss a week, you are welcome to join that week in the next offering.  This workshop will be continuously offered throughout the year.
