            <p>
              I came into the class not sure what to expect, and came out with
              some gems that I believe I will be using the rest of my life. Some
              gems I will hold onto are the “parachute statement” that I can
              share with others to more eloquently describe what my BFRB is, a
              personal picking strategy goal, and the process model to help me
              understand myself better. Jason’s clarity, content, and structure
              were so well defined throughout the whole course.
            </p>
            <p>
              With everything I had going on in life, taking this course did not
              add more stress, but in contrast, helped me make it through life
              stressors a little easier – knowing I was taking time for myself
              and what was important to me. I never felt pressured to do more
              than I was able, and what I did was good enough. Jason set
              reasonable goals and homework assignments that were not so much a
              chore, as something that I knew would improve my quality of life.
              I wanted to do all the assignments! I thought the slides were
              great, too. For some of the brainstorming slides, I really
              appreciated him limiting our thinking to 2 to 3 minutes. It
              prevented me from overthinking. It wasn’t overwhelming, and if I
              can make time to do this course, anyone can!!
            </p>
            <p>
              I also appreciated Jason’s vulnerability and thoughts throughout
              the whole course material. I always felt that he never asked
              anything of us that he wouldn’t expect of himself. Jason showed
              how he really cared, remembered what we said, and would reflect it
              back to us!
