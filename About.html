              Hello! My name is Jason and I compulsively pick my skin. 
            </p>
            <p>I’m guessing by the fact you’re reading this page you’ve heard of dermatillomania before, but maybe not! I mean, I ripped at my skin for 10 years, hours every day, and I had no idea this thing I was doing had a name. People would see my hands, and ask me if I wanted any lotion. I always knew this bad little habit wasn’t eczema, but I didn’t have the words to respond. 
            </p>

            <p>
              My feelings towards showing pictures of my hands are complicated. I’ve tried to rely on words, but I don’t think people really get it. I’ve also heard from people with BFRBs that showing pictures helps normalize them. My mind changes with the weather, but if you think seeing a picture of how my hands would help you understand me better, you can scroll down and click to see them below.

        <p>
          I still remember the moment when I learned the term <a href="https://www.bfrb.org/your-journey/what-is-a-bfrb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Body Focused Repetitive Behaviour</a> or BFRB. I was just finishing another phone call in my friend’s bathroom, and I saw<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo" class = "adelepostbutton">this facebook post</button>, and I felt all the wind get knocked out of my chest. 
        </p>

        <div id="demo" class="collapse">
          <div class="fidget-container">
            <img class="adele-image" alt="Adele Facebook Poste" src="./Adelepost.PNG" />
          </div>
          <div class="caption-container">
            <p>Thanks for saving my life Adele. No joke.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      

        <p>
          We met up and couldn’t stop talking about it. It was dawning on me that my BFRB was damaging so much more than just my hands. Soon after, I made the decision to leave my civil engineering career to learn as much as I could about BFRBs. I was guided by earnest questions I didn’t prepare for, but really, I was preparing my entire life. My journey led me to making some amazing friends, recording some embarrassing videos, and living the life I always wanted, but never could have imagined under the weight of my BFRB.

          If you’ve ever bled on an exam paper, spent your Friday night 1 inch from the mirror, or were too embarrassed to go swimming, I get it. And if you want to talk about it (or hear other people talk about it), I’m here for you [fidgetpodcast@gmail.com].

        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not picking my skin, or talking about picking my skin, I’m exploring the woods, or relistening to the same tiny desk concerts over and over again.
