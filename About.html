              Hello!
            </p>
            <p>My name is Jason and I compulsively pick my skin. For 10 years, people would see my dry cracked hands, and ask me if I wanted any lotion. I always knew this bad little habit was eczema, but I was too ashamed to ask for help. It wasn’t until I learned the term BFRB (Body Focused Repetitive Behavior) did it all start to make sense. I soon realized my BFRB was damaging so much more than just my hands. 
            </p>
            <p>
              So at 27, I quit my job as a civil engineer to learn as much about BFRBs as I could. Since then, I’ve made some amazing friends, recorded some embarrassing videos, and started living the life I always wanted, but could have never imagined under the weight of my BFRB.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you’ve ever bled on an exam paper, spent hours of your life 1 inch from the mirror, or were too embarrassed to go swimming, I get it. And if you want to talk about it (or hear other people talk about it), I’m here. 
            </p>
